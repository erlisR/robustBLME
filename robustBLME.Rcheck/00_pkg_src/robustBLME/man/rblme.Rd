\description{
This is the main function of the package which implements the method of Ruli et al. (2017). It fits robust Bayesian LMMs to data, via robust REML estimating functions. The robust estimating functions are those proposed by Richardson & Welsh (1995), which are robust versions of restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimating equations. An ABC-MCMC algorithm is used and the data are summarised through a rescaled version of the aforementioned estimating functions. See Ruli et al. (2017) for the details of the method. The current version (0.1.2) supports only models a single random effects. An extension for more general settings will be provided in the near future.
